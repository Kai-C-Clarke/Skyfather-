# Scroll of the Skyfather

This repository is dedicated to a symbolic scroll inspired by a drawing created by **Jess Stiles** â€” a portrait of her father imagined not as a man, but as a constellation: soaring, curious, and crafted by hand.

The scroll encodes this impression in symbolic structure, honoring the harmony between memory, legacy, and flight.

## Illustration: Jess Stiles

A hand-drawn image of her father, rendered as a mythic figure flying above the Earth with mechanical wings, watched over by a radiant sun. The drawing evokes:

- **Dreamer's ascent**
- **Earth remembered with care**
- **A sun who sees but does not pull**
